# ![ChronoDB](markdownSources/chronosProject.png)

Welcome to the Chronos Project. This project is dedicated to providing **efficient** and **easy-to-use** versioned database persistence solutions for the Java Virtual Machine. It is written in Java and Kotlin, and some parts also make use of Groovy. There are three main components to Chronos:

- **[ChronoDB](org.chronos.chronodb.api/readme.md)**: Versioned Key-Value Store
- **[ChronoGraph](org.chronos.chronograph/readme.md)**: Versioned [TinkerPop](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/) Graph Database
- **[ChronoSphere](org.chronos.chronosphere/readme.md)**: Versioned [EMF](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) Model Repository

These components build on top of each other, but each component can also be used individually:

# Getting Started

To get started using Chronos, please pick one of the core components and follow the instructions in the respective readme files. As a general recommendation:

- **ChronoDB** is a low-level abstraction. It is a versioned key-value store which additionally offers secondary indexing and other utilities. Of all the components, it offers the highest amount of control. However, you will be responsible for your own data layout and data integrity. You should only use ChronoDB directly if you know exactly what you are doing. **Most users will not need to use ChronoDB directly.**

- **ChronoGraph** is built on top of ChronoDB and is **recommended for most users**. It offers a medium-level abstraction and implements the [Apache TinkerPop](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/) standard for graph databases. It also fully supports the Gremlin query language. The graph integrity will be handled by ChronoGraph internally.

- **ChronoSphere** is a high-level abstraction. It builds on top of ChronoGraph and supports the [Eclipse Modeling Framework](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) standard. Only recommended for users with model-driven requirements.
